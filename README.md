# VGGImageAnnotator Remove Unlabelled
 Removes unlabelled images from the list of images in the json file.

Instructions :
Just place and run the script inside the folder in which you have your .json files that need to be altered/modified by removing data of images that don't have labels/regions. A new folder called 'Filtered' will be created and the modified files will be saved in side the folder.
